      <p class="bodytxt">At Kinderplatz, we see parents as our partners in care and teaching. We work to ensure that parents have the information they want and need, and to be a resource for their questions and concerns. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bulletlist">For all children, digital daily reports are provided on classroom activities, as well as the child&#8217;s behavior, sleep patterns and meals.</li>
        <li class="bulletlist">Each month, we email a newsletter which relays important information about activities and curriculum, as well as tips for our parents and center-wide reminders.  Additionally, the monthly newsletter often contains informative articles written by Kinderplatz staff and other childcare experts.</li>
        <li class="bulletlist">Parent&#8208;teacher conferences for children of all age groups are offered upon enrollment and whenever a child moves to a new age group.  Progress reports are prepared in the fall and spring, and parent&#8208;teacher conferences are offered to discuss assessment results, goals, and objectives.  Conferences can also be arranged upon request. Conferences are currently arranged via on-line platform.</li>
        <li class="bulletlist">Nursing mothers can take advantage of the quiet and privacy of our on-site lactation room at any time during hours of operation.</li>
        <li class="bulletlist">If you have healthcare concerns about your child, a nurse from the Minnesota Child Care Health Consultants (MNCCHC) is available for consultation upon request as needed.</li>
        <li class="bulletlist">For additional specific resources, please inquire.</li>
