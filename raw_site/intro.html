          Thank you for your interest in Kinderplatz. We hope this is the beginning of a wonderful experience for you and your child. The Kinderplatz Childcare and Education Center serves families with children ages 6 weeks through 8 years of age in our 15,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art space at Norman Pointe II in Bloomington, Minnesota. We accept children regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Center uses a comprehensive learning curriculum (The Creative Curriculum) and assessment system (Teaching Strategies GOLD®), and provides music, creative movement, sign language, Spanish language instruction and other cultural enrichment programs as an integrated part of the weekly tuition. Teachers use intentional and developmentally appropriate teaching practices to guide children’s learning through play, using both child-guided and adult-guided experiences.  As children learn extraordinary amounts through play and exploration, teachers spend a great deal of time engaged in hands-on activities at the children’s level. Perhaps appearing somewhat relaxed, teachers’ Kinderplatz uniform reflects their readiness for the types of interactive activities they have planned for each day.
          </p>
          <p>
          The classroom environments are structured to allow children to learn through a wide variety of interest centers, which include (but are not limited to): art, books, cognitive activities, blocks, dramatic play, games, music, and science. In addition, children are able to play indoors in a large muscle room, or  outdoors on the Center’s playground. Cultural enrichment, field trips, summer soccer camp, and individualized tutoring are also a part of our program.
          </p>

          Delicious, child-friendly catered lunches are planned together with the chefs at Nick's Wraps City Caf&eacute, located in the same building, right across the hall. The Center provides a nutritionally sound menu that follows USDA Child Nutrition Program guidelines — products are baked or steamed, never fried. Milk is served at morning snack and at lunch. Kinderplatz is a nut-free environment. Parents with children who have special dietary needs are asked to supply some of the food for their children. Culturally diverse foods are incorporated into our healthy and tasty menus.
