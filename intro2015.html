          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <h2>Welcome to Kinderplatz!</h2>

          <section>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in Kinderplatz. We hope this is the beginning of a wonderful experience for you and your child. The Kinderplatz Childcare and Education Center serves families with children ages 6 weeks through 10 years of age in our 15,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art space at Norman Pointe II in Bloomington, Minnesota. We accept children regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.</p>
            <p>The Center uses a comprehensive learning curriculum and assessment system by Teaching Strategies (<a href="http://www.teachingstrategies.com/">The Creative Curriculum</a>), and provides music, creative movement, sign language, Spanish language instruction and other cultural enrichment programs as an integrated part of the weekly tuition. In the classroom setting, children learn through a wide variety of interest centers which include (but are not limited to): art, books, cognitive activities, dramatic play, games, music, and science. In addition, children are able to play indoors in a large muscle room, or oudivoors on the Center’s playground. Cultural enrichment, field trips, summer soccer camp, and individualized tutoring are also a part of our program.</p>
            <p>The Center provides a nutritionally sound menu that follows USDA Child Nutrition Program guidelines — products are baked or steamed, never fried. Milk is served at breakfast and at lunch. Kinderplatz is a nut-free environment. Parents with children who have special dietary needs are asked to supply some of the food for their children.</p>
