          <p class="bodytxt">Kinderplatz recognizes that Active Duty Military families face unique challenges, especially with regard to finding and affording high quality child care.  To further support our Military families, long-term teaching staff at Kinderplatz has received specialized deployment training through SURGE. This training has helped teachers learn how to best support children and their families as they cope with deployment &mdash; before, during and after, military moves, and other unique circumstances related to the active duty military lifestyle. </p>
