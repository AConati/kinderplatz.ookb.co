      <p class="bodytxt"> We are committed to instilling a sense of community by helping children learn the importance of teamwork, caring for the environment, and playing a positive, active role in the world around them. Community awareness is promoted through field trips, in-house events, the involvement of community resources, local companies, and Center friends and family. These types of activities are planned as a regular part of children&rsquo;s curriculum and are intended to enhance classroom learning.</p>
      <p class="bodytxt">Along with these fun activities, we involve family members and others in the community in ways that enhance the children&#8217;s learning. We have had friends and family members who are: firefighters, police officers, pilots, veterinary technicians, bakers, and many others &#8212; come to share and do projects with the children.</p>
