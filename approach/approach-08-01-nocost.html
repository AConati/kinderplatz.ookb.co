                        Early exposure to other cultures and languages helps children develop understanding and acceptance of other cultures, as well as enhancing children’s understanding and appreciation of their own culture and language. In the Kinderplatz Spanish enrichment program, your child will embark on a wonderful language adventure in a fun environment where learning takes place naturally. Kinderplatz toddlers and preschoolers who are enrolled in traditional English classrooms (versus Spanish immersion students) attend weekly Spanish lessons taught by our on-staff Spanish teacher during the school year to learn about basic Spanish vocabulary and cultures of Spanish-speaking countries. (Alternately, Kinderplatz Spanish immersion students participate in various English enrichment activities during the school year with reading volunteers. <em><a href="agegroups-immersion.html">Click here</a> to learn more about the unique Spanish Immersion Program at Kinderplatz.</em>).

                          Music exposure and experiences cause children’s brains to develop more essential circuitry. This advanced circuitry enables greater learning in other areas of development, such as: math and science concepts, language and expression, attentive listening and social-emotional skills.

                          Weekly during the school year, our very own music teacher teaches general music to our infants through pre-k age children. Our music teacher has had training in Kindermusik instruction and attended workshops that explore numerous other creative ways to help children develop an early love for music that can last a lifetime.

                          Our creative movement program helps the infants through pre-k students establish greater balance, coordination, and large motor skills in a fun, active way. Through this program, children gain important life skills, such as: problem-solving, social-emotional growth, body control, language and listening, and basic math and science concepts. These are invaluable skills that are fostered at Kinderplatz.

                          Infants at Kinderplatz begin to learn some basic sign language throughout everyday experiences, such as drinking milk, eating food, and going down for a nap. Our infant classroom teachers demonstrate simple signs each day, along with the verbal words for each sign, as they go about daily activities and routines. This practice helps children to develop basic receptive language skills that later translate into expressive language. Early learning of sign language empowers even our youngest learners with early communication skills, and the self-confidence necessary for continued language development.

                        <p class="bodytxt">
                          Additionally, our Kinderplatz sign language instructors conduct weekly lessons with toddlers through pre-k to expand on their existing sign language knowledge.  Sign language can help teachers and children communicate from across a room without disruption to others and expand children’s understanding of language and communication diversity.

                          Along with each classroom’s individual cultural acceptance and understanding practices, Kinderplatz regularly invites one or more of our Center’s families as “tour guides” on pretend journeys around the world. In order to represent these countries and cultures of study authentically, we work together with families who originate from these areas to create displays that capture the values and special interests unique to these regions. Learning activities about each culture are incorporated into the classrooms’ everyday activities, including books and music from the region we are studying. At the end of each unit, families are invited to join us in a Center-wide celebration where we collectively enjoy delicious ethnic foods, music and live entertainment. You won’t want to miss out on these exciting events!
