        <h2>Welcome to Kinderplatz!</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Thank you for your interest in Kinderplatz. We hope this is the beginning of a wonderful experience for you and your child. The Kinderplatz Childcare and Education Center serves families with children ages 6 weeks through 10 years of age in our 15,000
            sq. ft. state-of-the-art space at Norman Pointe II in Bloomington, Minnesota. We accept children regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Center uses a comprehensive learning curriculum (The Creative Curriculum) and assessment system (Teaching Strategies GOLD®), and provides music, creative movement, sign language, Spanish language instruction and other cultural enrichment programs
            as an integrated part of the weekly tuition. In the classroom setting children learn through a wide variety of interest centers, which include (but are not limited to): art, books, cognitive activities, dramatic play, games, music, and science.
            In addition, children are able to play indoors in a large muscle room, or outdoors on the Center’s playground. Cultural enrichment, field trips, summer soccer camp, and individualized tutoring are also a part of our program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Center provides a nutritionally sound menu that follows USDA Child Nutrition Program guidelines — products are baked or steamed, never fried. Milk is served at breakfast and at lunch. Kinderplatz is a nut-free environment. Parents with children who
            have special dietary needs are asked to supply some of the food for their children.
