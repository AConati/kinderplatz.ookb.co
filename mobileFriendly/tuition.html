              <h4 class="mt2">Full-time/Part-time Enrollment Policies</h4>

              <h5>Enrollment Definitions:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><p class="m0"><strong>Part-Time:</strong>  2-3 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
                <li><p class="m0"><strong>Full-Time:</strong>  4-5 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="small">Note: Children may attend up to 10 hours per day. Overtime charges apply to any child that is at the Center more than fifty hours in one week.  No half-day rates are available, although Drop-In/Daily care &amp;/or Hourly care is available per prior approval from one of the Directors, when space allows.  Waiting List/Start Date priority is given to federal families and those interested in full-time enrollment. <em>Sibling Discount is available for full-time families only.</em></p>
              <p><strong>Weekly Contract:</strong>  Families that enroll their child(ren) part-time must contract for specific days of the week, to be changed only upon approval from the Directors.  Families that wish to attend on different days each week must pay for a full-time slot in their child(ren)&rsquo;s classroom(s), in order to allow for this type of scheduling flexibility.</p>

              <h5>Vacation/Sick Leave:</h5>
              <p><strong>Full-Time Families:</strong>  **Six months after each child&rsquo;s confirmed start date, full-time children are eligible for two weeks of vacation/sick leave per enrollment year. Vacation/sick leave can be used one or two weeks at a time.  Kinderplatz requires a two-week notice for one of these weeks, and will allow short notice for the other week.</p>
              <p><strong>Part-Time Families:</strong>  **Six months after each child&rsquo;s confirmed start date, part-time children are eligible for one week of vacation/sick leave per enrollment year.  Vacation/sick leave must be used a full week at a time.  A two-week notice is preferred.</p>
              <p class="small">**Note:  If a family switches from part-time to full-time enrollment, the family will not be eligible for full-time vacation/sick leave until six months after the contract change.  If switching from full-time to part-time enrollment, the part-time vacation/sick leave policy applies six months after the contract change.</p>

              <h5>Disenrollment:</h5>
              <p>Prior to a child&rsquo;s disenrollment by the family, a two-week notice is required.</p>

              <h5>Holiday Closings/Child Absence:</h5>
              <p><strong>Full-Time:</strong>  The tuition for the weeks in which holidays occur remains the same as any other week.  Families will pay weekly tuition rates even when their child is absent due to illness, appointments, or any other reason (with the exception of approved Vacation/Sick Leave).</p>
              <p><strong>Part-Time:</strong>  If the Center is closed due to a holiday on a child&rsquo;s contracted day, the family will not be required to pay for the day of closure.  Families will pay for contracted days even when their child is absent due to illness, appointments, or any other reason (with the exception of approved Vacation/Sick Leave).</p>
