                  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                  <dl>
                    <dt><h4>Q: What is the difference between Full Immersion, Dual Immersion and Partial Immersion?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A: <strong><em>Full Immersion:</em></strong> in the U.S. is intended for children whose primary language at home is English.  Full/One-Way Immersion is a process that begins by providing instruction in the target/foreign language for 90-100% of the child&rsquo;s school day.  The amount of instruction provided in the target language gradually decreases after the 2nd or 3rd year, to roughly 50% by the end of 5th grade.</p>
                        <p class="bodytxt"><strong><em>Dual Immersion:</em></strong> in the U.S. is intended for children who speak either English or the target language at home.  The Dual /Two-Way Immersion program is taught 50/50 in both English and the target language, enrolling a population of children whose home language is one or the other (at roughly 50/50 as well).  The dual immersion program is intended to be enriching for both segments of the population, as they come together and learn with and from each other.</p>
                        <p class="bodytxt"><strong><em>Partial Immersion:</em></strong> in the U.S. is any other form of foreign language immersion whereas a target language is taught in place of English for any portion of the day &ndash; not to be confused with language instruction, which is very different.</p>
                      </dd>
                    <dt><h4>Q:  What type of immersion program is used at Kinderplatz?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A:  Kinderplatz uses a partial immersion approach, by providing Spanish immersion to pre-k children for 3.5 hours per day, 2-3 days per week.  The Kinderplatz Spanish Immersion Program is different than most others in that it is intended for children whose home language is English, Spanish, or any other language.</p>
                      </dd>
                    <dt><h4>Q:  Explain the curriculum &ndash; how is it different or the same as an English-only program?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A: The curriculum in the Spanish classroom of the Pre-K program is the same (or very similar) to the English-only classroom, with the same goals and objectives.  Teachers from both classrooms plan together to ensure that objectives are being met simultaneously, so children are working on the same skills and activities in both.  The only difference between the two classrooms is who is teaching, and which language is being spoken. </p>
                      </dd>
                    <dt><h4>Q:  What are the benefits of an immersion program at such a young age?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A:  We recognize that most children attending the Spanish Immersion Program at Kinderplatz will most likely not move on to attend a Spanish immersion elementary school, but that has not deferred us at all from wanting to provide this unique and rewarding program.  Studies show that having exposure to and/or learning another language, will make it easier to learn any language (ie. a child who learned Spanish in preschool, will have an advantage learning any other language as well).  Young children absorb other languages like sponges (acquiring language rather than learning it), and are able to hear and say new sounds with much greater ease than older children and adults.  The older a person gets, the harder it is to &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; a new language, especially with any kind of native-like ability.  Children who begin to learn another language at a young age tend to develop better problem-solving skills than their monolingual peers, as well.</p>
                      </dd>
                    <dt><h4>Q: What can be expected developmentally from the children in the program?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A: On immersion days, some children may become more tired than usual, and either take a longer mid-day nap, or be ready for bedtime a bit earlier than usual. This fatigue is due to the brain working overtime to build brain connections (producing more grey matter than is typical for a monolingual child of the same age).</p>
                      </dd>
                    <dt><h4>Q:  Will my child be allowed to speak English in the Spanish classroom?</h4></dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p class="bodytxt">A: <strong><em>Absolutely yes.</em></strong> Children are not penalized for speaking in their primary language, though they can expect their teacher to respond to their English questions and comments in Spanish.  Children will be able to understand much more Spanish than they will be able to actually speak, especially at first.  Children will be encouraged to speak in the target language whenever possible, but not forced.  Positive social-emotional development is still be a top priority in both classrooms, as an essential skill children need for success in school and in life.</p>
